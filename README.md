# DATA1700-oblig1
 The first obligatory assignment in the class data1700 at OsloMet spring 2024.

 The assignment was to create a site for ordering movie tickets. The tickets should gather in an Array and there should be a button that could clear the array. 
 After the input was collected in an object, put in the array and posted on the site, the input boxes should clear themselves.

A big part of this assignment was to make input validation for the input fields in JavaScript. We were instructed to use regular expressions (regex) to validate phonenumbers and email addresses.
